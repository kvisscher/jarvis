# Project Jarvis #

Jarvis brought to life :)

## Compiliation ##

To compile "jarvis" you'll need the following libraries:

* libportaudio-2.0 (compiled from source)
* libespeak-dev
* libsphinxbase-dev
* libpocketsphinx-dev

## Compatibility ##

So far "jarvis" has only run on Ubuntu 13.04. But it'll probably run on other distrubtions as well.
